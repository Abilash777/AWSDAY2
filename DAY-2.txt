What is a webserver ?

Is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache. 
Written in C language.
Nginx has grown in popularity since its release due to its light-weight resource utilization and its ability to scale easily on minimal hardware.
used by high traffic websites such as Dropbox, Netflix,Zynga,NASA.

STATIC AND DYNAMIC

What is elastic IP ?

Elastic IP (explain in paint)
An Elastic IP address is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing.
By using an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software 
by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account.

S3(Amazon Simple Storage Service is a service offered by Amazon Web Services that provides object storage through a web service interface. 
===============================

1 S3 is KEY/value store for storing objects
2.Amazon S3 allows people to store objects 
  (files) " buckets" ( Directories) 
3. Buckets must have a globally unique name
4. Bukets are defined at the regional leval
5. Naming convention
6. No uppercase
7. NO underscore
8. 3-63 characters long
9. Not an IP
10. Must start with lowercase letter or number
11. Objects (files) have a key. The key is the full path.
12. <my_bucket>/my_file.txt
13. <my_bucket>/my_folder1/another_folder/myfile.txt 
14. Just keys with very long names that contains slashes "/"
15.  Object value is content of the body
16. Max size is 5 TB.
17. If uploading more than 5tb must use "Multi-part upload"
18. metadata (list of text key) value pairs
19. Tags
20. Version ID ( If versioning is enabled) 
21. how many bucket can create one aws account?

	100 buckets
	===========
	By default, you can create up to 100 buckets in each of your AWS accounts. 
	If you need additional buckets, 
	you can increase your account bucket limit to a maximum of 1,000 buckets
	by submitting a service limit increase.
	

	
AWS S3 - Versioning
====================

1. You can version your files in AWS S3.
2. It is enabled at the bucket level.
3. Same key overwritte will increment the Version
    1,2,3 
4. It is best practise to version your bucket.
5. Protect aganist unintended deletes
6. (Ability to restore a version)
7. Easy roll back to previous version
8. Any files that is is not versioned prior to enabling versioning 
     Version "null"

 Amazon S3 Storage Classes:

 ============================
 Amazon S3 offers a range of storage classes designed for different use cases.
 These include S3 Standard for general-purpose storage of frequently accessed data;
 S3 Intelligent-Tiering for data with unknown or changing access patterns; S3 Standard-Infrequent Access
 (S3 Standard-IA) and S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) 
 for long-lived, but less frequently accessed data; and Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) 
 and Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive (S3 Glacier Deep Archive) for long-term archive
 and digital preservation. If you have data residency requirements that can’t be
 met by an existing AWS Region, you can use the S3 Outposts storage class to 
 store your S3 data on-premises. Amazon S3 also offers capabilities to manage
 your data throughout its lifecycle. Once an S3 Lifecycle policy is set, 
 your data will automatically transfer to a different storage class without
 any changes to your application. 


General purpose
Amazon S3 Standard (S3 Standard)
================================

S3 Standard offers high durability, availability, and performance object storage for frequently 
accessed data. Because it delivers low latency and high throughput, 
S3 Standard is appropriate for a wide variety of use cases, 
including cloud applications, dynamic websites, content distribution,
 mobile and gaming applications, and big data analytics. 
 S3 Storage Classes can be configured at the object level 
 and a single bucket can contain objects stored across S3 Standard, 
 S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard-IA, and S3 One Zone-IA. 
 You can also use S3 Lifecycle policies to automatically transition objects between storage 
 classes without any application changes. 
 
 
 Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering (S3 Intelligent-Tiering):
 ========================================================
 
 Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering (S3 Intelligent-Tiering) is the only cloud storage
 class that delivers automatic cost savings by moving objects between four access
 tiers when access patterns change. The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed
 to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, 
 without operational overhead. 
 
 
 Key Features:
 =============

Automatically optimizes storage costs for data with changing access patterns
Stores objects in four access tiers, optimized for frequent, infrequent, archive, and deep archive access
Frequent and Infrequent Access tiers have same low latency and high throughput performance of S3 Standard
Activate optional automatic archive capabilities for objects that become rarely accessed
Archive access and deep Archive access tiers have same performance as Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive
Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones
Designed for 99.9% availability over a given year


Infrequent access
Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
====================================================

S3 Standard-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently,
 but requires rapid access when needed. 
 S3 Standard-IA offers the high durability, 
 high throughput, and low latency of S3 Standard,
 with a low per GB storage price and per GB retrieval fee. 
 
 Key Features:
 ================

Same low latency and high throughput performance of S3 Standard
Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones
Resilient against events that impact an entire Availability Zone
Data is resilient in the event of one entire Availability Zone destruction
Designed for 99.9% availability over a given year

Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
=====================================================

S3 One Zone-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently, 
but requires rapid access when needed. Unlike other S3 Storage 
Classes which store data in a minimum of three Availability Zones (AZs),
 S3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single AZ and costs 20% less than S3 Standard-IA. 
 S3 One Zone-IA is ideal for customers who want a lower-cost option for infrequently 
 accessed data but do not require the availability and resilience of S3 Standard or 
 S3 Standard-IA. It’s a good choice for storing secondary backup copies of on-premises
 data or easily re-creatable data. You can also use it as cost-effective storage 
 for data that is replicated from another AWS Region using S3 Cross-Region Replication.
 
 Key Features:
 ================
Same low latency and high throughput performance of S3 Standard
Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects in a single Availability Zone†
Designed for 99.5% availability over a given year
Backed with the Amazon S3 Service Level Agreement for availability
Supports SSL for data in transit and encryption of data at rest
S3 Lifecycle management for automatic migration of objects to other S3 Storage Classes

Archive
Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier)
===============================

S3 Glacier is a secure, durable, and low-cost storage class for data archiving. 
You can reliably store any amount of data at costs that are competitive with or cheaper 
than on-premises solutions. To keep costs low yet suitable for varying needs, 
S3 Glacier provides three retrieval options that range from a few minutes to hours.
 You can upload objects directly to S3 Glacier, or use S3 Lifecycle policies
 to transfer data between any of the S3 Storage Classes for active data (S3 Standard,
 S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard-IA, and S3 One Zone-IA) and S3 Glacier. 
 
 Key Features:
 ==================
Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones
Data is resilient in the event of one entire Availability Zone destruction
Supports SSL for data in transit and encryption of data at rest
Low-cost design is ideal for long-term archive
Configurable retrieval times, from minutes to hours

Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive (S3 Glacier Deep Archive)
==========================================================
S3 Glacier Deep Archive is Amazon S3’s lowest-cost storage class and supports 
long-term retention and digital preservation for data that may be accessed 
once or twice in a year. It is designed for customers — particularly those 
in highly-regulated industries, such as the Financial Services, Healthcare,
 and Public Sectors — that retain data sets for 7-10 years or longer to meet 
 regulatory compliance requirements. 
 
 Key Features:
 ================

Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zone
Lowest cost storage class designed for long-term retention of data that will be retained for 7-10 years
